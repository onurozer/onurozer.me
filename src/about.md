Hi, I'm Onur. I'm a marketer and web developer. During the day, I run a marketing & growth consultancy for startups.

Here are some random facts about me:

- My first job was a web developer at an agency in 2001. I quickly realised I wanted to run an agency one day so spent the next six years acquiring the skills to do so. I started Nerdverk in 2007.
- In 2010, I was invited to a meeting in Singapore, which turned into launching an ecommerce startup, a few jobs and living 10 years there.
- Until 25 I was convinced that I would become a drummer. I became a marketer instead.
- I'm a lifelong fan of jazz, but lately super into hip hop and UK grime.
- Cocktails, anyone? I spent a boozy few years reading about, practicing and learning the art and science of making proper cocktails.
- Cooking with my wife. Elobarate setup at home, serious home cooking.
- Interest in airlines and loyalty programs. Working in credit cards in industry taught me a lot.
- Did yoga for 5 years. Now into functional training at the gym.
- Love strategy games, rpgs and lately Elden Ring.
- Read a lot!
- Travelling fan. Ask me anything about Singapore, Istanbul, Amsterdam
