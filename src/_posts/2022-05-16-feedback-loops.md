Big life events can be stressful. Moving to a new country, starting a new business and living through a global pandemic are challenging on their own. They are overwhelming together.

In 2020, all three happened to me at the same time. I moved to Switzerland and learned French, started Simple Matters while the pandemic was in full force. I kept myself busy with taking onlince courses, learning, writing articles, podcasting and learning how to code.

My goal has been to start an internet business, but the way I went about it was wrong. It went through cycles of motivation - feeling super excited about an idea, working on it for a week weeks, bringing to 80% and never launching. Never closing the feedback loop on it.

When you have a job, your colleagues and bosses give you feedback all the time, whether you like it or not. When you’re building in public, the communities you’re part of are helping you. When you’re doing neither, there’s no one to close the loop. You’re building in a vacuum. And without air , your motivation suffocates and dies bringing down your project with it.
