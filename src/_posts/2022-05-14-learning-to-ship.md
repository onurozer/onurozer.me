Recently I launched [APAC Agencies](https://www.apacagencies.com) in just one week, after procrastinating on it for months. This was a great exercise in learning how to stop over-thinking and actually ship a product. Here's what helped:

## Working with a partner

My original design was hardly inspiring, so I asked [Oygar](https://www.oygarerdal.com) for help. Being a solo founder can be hard. Being able to bounce off ideas, keeping each other accountable and making steady progress kept us both inspired and helped us build momentum.

## Fixing scope instead of time

Setting out to launch the project in a week forced us to make hard decisions early-on. Instead of fixing scope, we fixed the deadline and cut down the scope. That forced us to focus and ask ourselves at every step: does this feature help us ship faster? Will this feature deliver value from day one? Can we get away without building it now?

## Picking the right tools

Originally I was convinced that this site needed to have user accounts, OAuth, a voting tool and a CMS. I even built some of it using [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which introduced some complexity. It turned out that we could build a much simpler, static version in [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com) and [Airtable](https://airtable.com) to validate the idea. If it works, there will always be time to improve it later. If it doesn't, then the tech stack won't matter.

The next step is getting real-world feedback, and experimenting with alternating between [coding and marketing](https://codingweekmarketingweek.com) each week to keep the momentum going.
