I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently I live in Singapore with my wife. 

- I played drums for about 10 years in my 20s. I was pretty convinced that I'd be a successful musician. I became a marketer instead.

*Long before stable photography was invented*

- In 2007, I co-founded a [web design studio](https://nerdverk.com). On the day we signed a big contract, our programmer announced that he quit. I remember googling "[what is SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)" and eventually implementing it with ASP.NET and Visual Basic. It was painful. 

- I came to Singapore in 2010 to start e-commerce business as the only marketer. We were too early: the businesses didn't think they needed to be online at the time. The startup failed after three years, but I ended up staying in Singapore for more than a decade. 

- In 2015, I moved to an apartment next to a yoga studio. One day, I gave it a try and failed miserably. Refusing to be so unfit, I signed up on the spot and kept going for the next 4 years.

- In 2019, we moved to a small village in Switzerland. Our only friends were cows and roosters. In the first few months, I spent my first few months learning French so I could buy a car and order raclette. Best part of living in Switzerland was travelling around Europe. We moved back to Singapore exactly three years later.

- I [cook](https://forage.sg) a lot. At least that's what I tell myself everytime I buy a Japanese knife.
