I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey. Currently I live in Singapore with my wife. 

- I played drums from the age of 15 to 25. At some point I was convinced that I'd become a famous musician. I became a marketer instead.

*Long before stable photography was invented*

- In 2007, I started started a [web development studio](https://nerdverk.com) with my designer business partner. On the day we signed a big contract for an API project, our programmer announced that he had decided to quit. I remember coming back to the office and googling "[what is SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP)" and eventually implementing it with ASP.NET and Visual Basic. It was painful. 

- I originally came to Singapore in 2010 for a meeting. The plan was to explore joining a new e-commerce startup as the only marketer. A month later, I went back to Istanbul, packed my luggage and returned to Singapore. The startup failed, but I ended up staying for more than 10 years. 

- In 2015, I moved into a new apartment next to a yoga studio. One day, I decided to give it a try. I sweated profusely and failed miserably. Refusing to be so unfit, I signed up on the spot kept going for the next 5 years.

*Almost there, but not quite*

- Just before the pandemic in 2019, we moved to a small village in Switzerland. Our only friends were cows and roosters. In the first few months, I learned enough French to buy a car and Raclette.

- I [cook](https://forage.sg) a lot. At least that's what I tell myself everytime I buy a new Japanese knife.

- I like Japanese [games](https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/), British [humour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peep_Show_(British_TV_series)), American [TV shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_(2009_TV_series)) and Singaporean food.
